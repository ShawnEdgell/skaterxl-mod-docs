  <h2>Innovative Grind Spline Tool</h2>
  <p>
    The Grind Tools Mod introduces the Grind Spline Tool, a groundbreaking feature that allows players to add and remove custom splines in Skater XL maps. Tailor your skating environment with scalable splines, and choose between box and capsule collider types for varied skating experiences.
  </p>

  <h2>Wax Tool for Enhanced Control</h2>
  <p>
    The Wax Tool is a key feature of the mod, enabling players to adjust friction levels on surfaces. This tool transforms regular grindable surfaces into coping, and even allows you to switch the material tag from concrete to metal, providing more control over your skating session.
  </p>

  <h2>Easy Access and Additional Controls</h2>
  <p>
    Activating Grind Tools in-game is effortless. Access it from the pause menu or in map editor mode with a simple button press. Easily toggle between the Wax tool and the Grind Spline Tool with intuitive controls, and additional options are conveniently displayed on-screen for smooth navigation.
