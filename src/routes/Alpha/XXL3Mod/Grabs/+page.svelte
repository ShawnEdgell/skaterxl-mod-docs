  <h1>XXL 3 Mod: Grabs</h1>

  <h2>Grab Mode</h2>
  <p>
    Customize your grab experience with different modes: 'SXL' for the default setup, 'XXL3' for custom grabs with more control and options, or 'Off' to disable grab mod features.
  </p>

  <h2>Board Offset During Grabs</h2>
  <p>
    Adjust how far or close the board is to the player during grabs, affecting both the aesthetics and the feel of the trick.
  </p>

  <h2>Bodyflips</h2>
  <p>
    Toggle bodyflips on or off, adding another dimension to your grabs. When enabled, incorporate flips into your grabs for a more dynamic performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Bodyflip Speed</h2>
  <p>
    If bodyflips are enabled, this setting allows you to control the speed of flips, offering a way to fine-tune how fast or slow your character rotates.
  </p>

  <h2>Style</h2>
  <p>
    Choose between 'Custom' for personalized grab actions or stick with the 'XXL 3' default settings for a standardized experience. This setting lets you define the overall approach to grabs in the game.
