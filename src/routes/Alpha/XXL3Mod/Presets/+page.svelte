  <h1>XXL 3 Mod: Presets</h1>
  <h2>Overview of Presets</h2>
  <p>
    Presets in the XXL 3 Mod allow for saving, sharing, and installing custom configurations for Skater XL. These include stats, stances, and steeze settings, enabling personalized skateboarding experiences. Remember, your settings might be tailored to your preferred riding stance, whether regular or goofy.
  </p>

  <h2>Managing Preset Files</h2>
  <p>
    Presets can be managed in the 'Documents/SkaterXL/XXLMod3' folder on your computer. Look for the 'StanceCollections', 'StatsCollections', and 'SteezeCollections' subfolders to add or share custom presets.
  </p>
<h2>Saving Preset Files</h2>
<p>
  Saving presets in the XXL 3 Mod is straightforward. You can either press "P" or open the presets tab within the mod. From there, navigate using the dropdown menu to the Stats, Steeze, and Stance sections. Before saving your presets, make sure to give them a descriptive name. Once you click 'Save', the preset files will be stored in your preset folders. These presets can be loaded in the game for future use, allowing you to quickly switch between your custom configurations.
