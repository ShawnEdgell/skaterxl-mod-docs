  <h2>How to Use the XXL 3 Mod</h2>
  <p>
    To access the mod, simply press <b>F7</b> on your keyboard. This will open the main menu of the mod. From here, you can click through each category/section and set up your settings. If you're starting from scratch, we recommend going through the categories in order from top to bottom to fully customize your Skater XL experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the mod allows you to load custom presets created by others. For more information on presets, including how to find and load them, check out our 
    <a href="/Alpha/XXL3Mod/Presets">Presets </a>
    page.

  <h3>Note for Laptop Users</h3>
  <p>
    If you are using a laptop and have trouble opening the mod with the F7 key, you might need to enable your function keys. This is often done by pressing the <b>Fn</b> key along with the respective function key (e.g., Fn + F7). In some cases, laptops have a setting in the BIOS or UEFI firmware to toggle the function keys between multimedia keys and standard function keys. Refer to your laptop's user manual or check the manufacturer's support website for specific instructions.
