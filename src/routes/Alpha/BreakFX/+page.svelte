  <h2>Realistic Board Break Mechanics</h2>
  <p>
    The Break FX Mod introduces an immersive and dynamic element to Skater XL - the ability for your skateboard to break. This mod adds a touch of realism to your gameplay, with the likelihood of your board breaking increasing based on the impact velocity during tricks and landings.
  </p>

  <h2>Enhanced Replay Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Witness the dramatic moments of your skateboard breaking in replays for an enhanced visual experience. To capture the broken board effect in replays, remember to enter the replay mode before respawning, as respawning will reset the broken deck.
  </p>

  <h2>Compatibility Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    While the Break FX Mod adds an exciting feature, it may not visually align perfectly with all truck types due to differences in UV mapping. Additionally, the mod's visual effects might not appear as intended when used in conjunction with DeckFX's Boardwear features, so keep this in mind for the best aesthetic experience.
