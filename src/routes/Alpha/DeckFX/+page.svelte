      <b>⚠️ Important:</b> After installing the DeckFX and XXL3 mods, you should then head to DawgVinci's discord to grab the 'DeckFX Fix' file. This next step is crucial to prevent gameplay issues.

  <h2>DeckFX Fix</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't have the DeckFX fix yet, you might notice your trucks get 'stuck' when doing manuals and grinds. This may negatively impact your gaming experience by causing issues with turning mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is because the DeckFX and XXL3 mods overlap eachother, affecting the 'Loose Trucks' feature in DeckFX. 
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    To fix this, head to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GmuBn6UzUh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DawgVinci's Discord</a> and grab the 'DeckFX Fix' file from the #xxlmod section. You will need to scroll up to find the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/752873695344853033/752879229842096239/845745450677174373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeckFX Fix for v1.2</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download and extract the file, then place the DeckFX.dll file here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code><b>SkaterXL/Mods/DeckFX</b></code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Click 'replace.' This will ensure the DeckFX mod works as intended, allowing for a seamless skateboarding experience.

  <h2>How to Use the Deck FX Mod</h2>
  <p>
    Once installed, the Deck FX Mod can be accessed in-game by pressing <b>F3</b>. Use the sliders to adjust various aspects of your skateboard to suit your preferences.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Note for Laptop Users</h3>
  <p>
    If you're using a laptop and find it challenging to activate the mod using the F3 key, you may need to enable your function keys. This can typically be done by pressing the <b>Fn</b> key in combination with the respective function key (e.g., Fn + F3). Some laptops also have a BIOS or UEFI firmware setting to switch the function keys from multimedia to standard functionalities. Check your laptop's user manual or the manufacturer's support site for specific guidance.
