  <h2>Enabling Decals and Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    The Decal Fix Mod is a crucial enhancement for Skater XL, enabling the use of decals and screen space reflections in maps that contain decals. This modification breathes new life into the game's environments, adding a layer of realism and visual appeal with detailed graffiti and reflective surfaces.
  </p>

  <h2>Simple Installation Process</h2>
  <p>
    Installing the Decal Fix Mod is straightforward. Unlike script mods, it doesn't require Unity Mod Manager. Instead, it involves replacing a single file in the game's directory. After downloading, simply drag the "globalgamemanagers.assets" file to your Skater XL installation folder, and confirm the replacement of the existing file.
  </p>

  <h2>Immediate Visual Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Once installed, the difference is immediately noticeable. Check maps like "Donevan Recreation Center" or "OldBrooks Factory" to see the enhanced graffiti on ramps and walls, offering a more immersive and vibrant skateboarding environment.
