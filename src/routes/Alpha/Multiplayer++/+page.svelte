  <h2>Enhanced Room Browsing and Management</h2>
  <p>
    Multiplayer++ Mod elevates the Skater XL multiplayer experience with improved room browsing and management features. The mod fixes the previously broken "refresh list" button and modifies the "Join New Map" button for enhanced room browsing functionality, allowing you to explore and join public rooms with ease.
  </p>

  <h2>Create and Join Public Rooms</h2>
  <p>
    Dive into the multiplayer world by creating and joining public rooms. While these features were initially hidden in the game, Multiplayer++ Mod makes them readily accessible and user-friendly, encouraging community engagement and interactive gameplay.
  </p>

  <h2>Room Browser Enhancements</h2>
  <p>
    The improved room browser now displays all available rooms, including those with maps you haven't installed. This transparency allows you to see which maps you might want to download next, broadening your skateboarding horizons within the Skater XL community.
  </p>

  <h2>User Interface Improvements</h2>
  <p>
    The Multiplayer++ Mod also introduces subtle yet impactful changes to the user interface. The "Join New Map" button in public rooms now serves as a more effective room browser, despite the unchanged button text. These adjustments create a smoother and more intuitive multiplayer experience.
