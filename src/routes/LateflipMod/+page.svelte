  <h1>Lateflip Mod</h1>
  
  <h2>Refined Late Flip Mechanics</h2>
  <p>
    The Lateflip Mod introduces improved and realistic late flip mechanics to Skater XL. It offers a more authentic skateboarding experience by enabling precise control over late shuvits and late flips. The mod fixes late shuv catches and removes unintended late flips after pressing the pop stick, ensuring that late tricks are executed as intended.
  </p>

  <h2>Advanced Late Trick Controls</h2>
  <p>
    Engage in advanced late trick maneuvers with this mod. Execute late shuvs by pressing the pop stick and the shuv input during an ollie, without interfering with XXL3's late shuvs. The mod also increases the time window to perform late flips and shuvs, allowing for more fluid and dynamic trick execution.
  </p>

  <h2>Seamless Integration with XXL3</h2>
  <p>
    The Lateflip Mod seamlessly integrates with XXL3, enhancing its late flip functionalities. It's compatible with specific XXL3 versions and requires "flips after pop" to be enabled in XXL3 for optimal performance. The mod is always enabled upon game start, with easy toggle options using shortcut keys.
  </p>

  <h2>Customizable Late Trick Settings</h2>
  <p>
    Customize your late trick experience with adjustable settings for scoop speed under XXL3's flips settings. Late flips follow the speed settings of kickflips or heelflips, depending on the stance and trick type, providing a consistent and realistic skateboarding experience.
