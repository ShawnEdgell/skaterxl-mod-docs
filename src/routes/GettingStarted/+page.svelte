  <h2>Download & Setup UnityModManager</h2>
  <p>
    For Skater XL version 1.2.2.8: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21?tab=files&file_id=2224">UnityModManager v0.27.4</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    For Skater XL version 1.2.7.8: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21?tab=files&file_id=2314">UnityModManager v0.27.7</a>
  </p>
  <p class="italic mt-2">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Choosing the right version is mandatory for your mods to work. Delete your old mod manager before using one of these.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>
    After you have the .zip file downloaded, right-click it and select Extract All. This will create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file. You can then open the folder and proceed to the next step.
  </p>

  <p class="italic">
    In this example, we are saving UnityModManager to our Desktop. You can save it anywhere you want, just make sure you know where it is.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>
    Open the UnityModManager.exe file. This will open a window that looks like the one below.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Set <b>Game</b> to Skater XL from the drop-down menu. Set <b>Folder</b> to your Skater XL game folder, usually located here:
  </p>
  <p class="ml-2 italic">
    This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Skater XL
  </p>
  <p>
    Click <b>Install</b> or <b>Update.</b> You should now see Ingame Version: 0.27.X.X. This means your UnityModManager is set up, and you can go ahead and install your mods.
  </p>

  <img src="UMM2.png" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="my-4" />

  <p class="italic">
    If you don't see Ingame Version: 0.27.X.X, you may have selected the wrong game folder or forgot to click Install.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p class="mt-2">
    <b>Download</b> mods. You can use the sidebar to find every working mod in Skater XL. <b>Drag & Drop</b> your mod .zip files into UnityModManager. This will complete the installation process, and they will now be usable in-game!
  </p>

  <img src="UMM3.png" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" class="my-4" />

  <p class="italic">
    All of your installed mods will say <b>Status: OK</b> or <b>Status: Update X.X.X,</b> this means the mod is installed properly. If this section is blank, the mod is not installed in your game. You can right-click each mod to manually install/uninstall.
  </p>
  <p class="italic mt-2">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not 'Update' your mods here unless you are sure you are switching to the correct version. This can cause your mods to break, and you will have to reinstall them.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>
    Launch Skater XL! You should now see the UnityModManager application open on startup. üü¢ Green icon means your mod is most likely working. Refer to the mod page to find out how to open and use it. üî¥ Red icon means your mod is broken. These mods will need to be uninstalled or updated to the proper working version.
  </p>
