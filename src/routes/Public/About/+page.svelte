    <h1>Skater XL v1.2.7.8 (Public Version)</h1>
  
    <h2>Optimized for Vert Skating</h2>
    <p>
      The highlight of v1.2.7.8 is its emphasis on vert skating. Thanks to the grabs update, this version stands out as the optimal choice for players who love shredding bowls and ramps. The update brings a level of realism and finesse to vert skating that is unmatched in previous versions, making it a must-try for enthusiasts of this style.

    <h2>XL Mod: A New Take on the Stats Menu</h2>
    <p>
      While the XL Mod in this version offers fewer features compared to the previous XXL 3 Mod, it's built from the ground up to provide a streamlined experience. Players can still enjoy customizing their gameplay, albeit with a more focused set of options that align with the core gameplay changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skater XL v1.2.7.8 marks a significant advancement in skateboarding simulation, introducing new features like seamless darkslides and wallrides. This version may not boast the extensive mod support of the alpha branch, but it excels in providing a refined, core skateboarding experience with fresh mechanics that enhance gameplay.

    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      While Skater XL v1.2.7.8 brings exciting core gameplay improvements, it's important to note that it offers less flexibility in customizing gear and trick styling compared to the alpha version. The absence of mods like the XL Gear Mod means that players have more limited options in tailoring their skater's appearance and gear. Additionally, the scope for customizing trick mechanics and styles is not as extensive as in the alpha version.
