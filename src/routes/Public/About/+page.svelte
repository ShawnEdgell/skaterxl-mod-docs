    <h1>Skater XL v1.2.7.8 (Public Version)</h1>
  
    <h2>Optimized for Vert Skating</h2>
    <p>
      The highlight of v1.2.7.8 is its emphasis on vert skating. Thanks to the grabs update, this version stands out as the optimal choice for players who love shredding bowls and ramps. The update brings a level of realism and finesse to vert skating that is unmatched in previous versions, making it a must-try for enthusiasts of this style.
    </p>

    <h2>Considerations for the Public Version</h2>
    <p>
      While Skater XL v1.2.7.8 brings exciting core gameplay improvements, it's important to note that it offers less flexibility in customizing gear and trick styling compared to the alpha version. The absence of mods like the XL Gear Mod means that players have more limited options in tailoring their skater's appearance and gear. Additionally, the scope for customizing trick mechanics and styles is not as extensive as in the alpha version.
