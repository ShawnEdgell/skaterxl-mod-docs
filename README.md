- **Vite**: A blazing fast, next-generation frontend build tool, Vite provides a smooth and efficient development experience.
- **Svelte**: A radical new approach to building user interfaces, Svelte shifts much of the work into a compile step, resulting in smaller, faster runtime code with less boilerplate.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, we use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in the markup.

## Features

- **Interactive Sidebar**: Navigate through various categories and subcategories with an easy-to-use sidebar that includes accordion-style dropdowns for efficient browsing.
